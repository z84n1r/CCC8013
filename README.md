Grading of assignment
This assignment contributes towards   15% of   your final   grade   for   the   course.   See   the   last   page   of   this   document   for   the   detailed   breakdown   of   how   this   assignment   will   be   graded.
Instructions for assignment
In   this   assignment,   we   will   utilize   the   ecological   footprint   (EF)   data   collected   in   Lab   3   to   examine patterns in resource usage among Lingnan students. We will also estimate the amount   of   biologically productive areas on Earth needed to sustain our demands.    Through this   assignment, you will showcase your analytical skills by analyzing and presenting data, as well   as   effectively   communicating   your   findings   and   interpretations   through   written   explanations   and   graphs   (Graphs   - Lab   5      6). Furthermore, based   on your   findings,   you will   be   expected   to provide recommendations on how to transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle. (Lab 4).
Your   job in this assignment   is:
•          Download   the   class   EF   data,   which   can   be   found   on   Moodle   in   the   SDG   assignment   underWritten   Assignments.
•          Utilize your   own judgment   to   analyze   the   class   data   in   a way   that   you   find   suitable.   For   instance, you could identify which activity contributed to the most EF for Lingnan students,   compare   water   use   between   students   living   in   student   hostels   and   those   living   at   home,   identify   relationship   between   代 写CCC8013 The Process of SciencePython

•          Present the results obtained from your analysis either in a table or as text within the main   text.   Use   graphs   to   visually   illustrate   your   findings   and   the   key   messages   you   want   to   convey.   Provide   interpretations   and   explanations   of the   results   presented   in   these   graphs   within the main text. Each student is expected to create   two graphs of   different types   (e.g.,   bar chart and scatter plot)   for this assignment.
•          Discuss the implications of your results from a broader perspective and      provide   recommendations on how to transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle.   Support your   interpretations and recommendations with relevant literature. Do not plagiarize!
